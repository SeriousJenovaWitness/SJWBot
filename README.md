SJW Bot
=======

**SJW Bot** (aka "Serious Jenova Witness Bot") is a Twitter bot that looks 
for users blocked for being anti-GamerGate. The source of the list is here:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sstjohn/sjwautoblocker/master/block_names.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sstjohn/sjwautoblocker/master/block_names.txt)

All you need to run it is a Twitter account and API keys. Once you have both, 
execute it once to generate a config file and then edit the file with the 
appropriate data from Twitter.

The purpose of this is to let those who have been blocked by those who are 
trumpeting GamerGate and all of its ills. It does so silently and does not 
do anything other than tweet.

The real bot is working at this account:
